            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A REVINDICATION OF PSALM. 105. VERS. 15. <hi>Touch not mine Anointed, &amp;c.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hy, <hi>A vindication of Pſalme</hi> 105.15? <hi>Touch not mine Anointed, &amp;c.</hi> As if the man would perverſely intimate to theſe miſunderſtanding times, that there were no other Text of Scripture to that ſelf-ſame ſenſe and ſcope; from which hee would pretend to vindicate this. And ſo (this vindicated) the Truth it ſelfe muſt quite fall to the ground. Elſe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore keeps he ſuch a whittling about one ſlender ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row (as he takes it) when the quiver is full of ſtrong ſhafts, and ſuch as flie mainly at the marke? thinks he the whole hedge muſt needs lie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, becauſe the thiefe tugs hard to ſteale one ſtake out of it? This houſe (like the houſe founded upon a rock) is built upon ſurer pillars, then to totter, though one prop be wrencht away. No, no, I can aſſure him, the muſters are compleat, &amp; the cauſe will be ſtoutly maintained againſt him, though he would labour never ſo to invegle one ſingle man away from it.</p>
            <p>But this is not all, to deprave a Truth, which is factious hereſie: but there's as ill as that, to ſtrike at the perſon whom that truth concernes; which is villanous treachery. For why would he not have Kings here meant to be <hi>Gods Anointed?</hi> becauſe ſuch are abſolutely inhibited here to be <hi>toucht.</hi> So then he would therefore invalide the truth of the thing, that ſo he might give licence to the injury of the fact. Princes (for him) might have beene here alſo underſtood <hi>Gods Anointed,</hi> but that it is here ſo plainly inhibited to <hi>touch</hi> them. How to touch them? with a very malignant touch. For ſo the ancient in their tranſlation expound <hi>tange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,</hi> by <hi>malignari.</hi> We ſee then who are ſimply the Malignants; even thoſe that dare offer to <hi>touch the Lords Anointed.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="2" facs="tcp:36658:3"/>
            <p>Now ſeeing he excepts againſt a ſingle man in this royall army, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will needs in ſimulate him, to deny his colours; we will ſet him aſide awhile, and have at him with double and treble forces from another wing. At him? No. I hold it more honourable to retreat at firſt on-ſet ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then offer to skirmiſh with a ſeditious Pamphleter, againſt whom all victory is but loſſe and ſhame.</p>
            <p>Wherefore waving him (for he is prepoſſeſt) I earneſtly wiſh all Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects (that are Chriſtian and godly) to be well inſtructed in thoſe words 1. Sam. 24.6, 10, 12. of their right meaning, of their true uſe. Which done throughbly, then themſelves may be pleaſed to call in the man, and ask him, If here be not a conſcience fully convinced of a <hi>divine inhibition,</hi> when he ſaies, <hi>The Lord forbid.</hi> A phraſe (both here and in many other places of Scripture) noting not onely an inhibition, but a conſcience convicted of that inhibition: and not onely a conviction, but a reſolution not to practice againſt it: and not onely not to practice againſt it himſelfe; but not ſo much as yeild or ſuffer others ſo to do. Ask him againe, whether thoſe words (of <hi>ſtretching forth the hand againſt the Lords Anointed</hi>) be to be interpreted and applied <hi>not to Kings, but onely to ſubjects, and as ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects?</hi> ſurely the mans own ignorance is not ſo much, as that his malice dares now be peremptory: neither his malice ſo much, as to preſume he may here alſo obtrude upon others ignorance. If he have either know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge or conſcience; he cannot but confeſſe, here's a Divine inhibition gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to ſubjects, not to Kings; who are (in a peculiar manner) the <hi>Lords Anointed,</hi> and not they.</p>
            <p>Let all true ſubjects learn what <hi>David</hi> ſayes again, 1. Sam. 26.9, 10, 11. <hi>Who can ſtretch forth his hand againſt the Lords anointed?</hi> He demands <hi>Who,</hi> in the univerſall and indefinite, to note, that no man ought to do ſuch an act, of what place or power, of what condition or concernment ſoever. He ſayes, <hi>and be guiltleſſe,</hi> to note, ther's no humane cauſe or command can ſufficiently warrant hereunto: much leſſe can Jealouſies, ſuſpicions, ſuppoſals, excuſes, pretences; which alſo have a guilt of their own, beſides that of the fact they would induce unto. In the 10 verſe he leaves the <hi>Lords anointed</hi> in every thing, to the Judgement of the Lord himſelfe; noting, that Kings are puniſhable for their offences, not by men, much leſſe their own Subjects, but are to be referred herein to God alone. Laſtly he ſayes, <hi>The Lord forbid,</hi> or <hi>the Lord keepe me from:</hi> noting it to be a worke of reſtraining grace, <hi>not to ſtretch forth the hand againſt the Lords anointed.</hi> The Fanaticks, out of their <hi>Enthuſiaſmes,</hi> do ill then to incite men hereunto, by making it a motion of the Spirit.</p>
            <p>But good Subjects heed moreover the 2. Sam. 1.14, 16. See here a juſt
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:36658:3"/>example of one, that did but pretend to practice contrary to this awfull truth. The <hi>Amalekite</hi> had not once touched the <hi>Lords Anointed</hi> to ſuch a fact. For ('tis evident in this Chapter, as alſo 1. Sam. 31. and 1. Chron. 10.) that King Saul died by his own act, yet certainly the vile wretch had a will to ſuch a deed; and that made him boaſt as if he had done it. Now to boaſt, and lie, and diſſemble, &amp; pretend in buſineſſe of ſo high a nature; and concerning ſo mighty a perſonage, as that of a King, was of it ſelf worthy of ſevereſt puniſhment: And <hi>David</hi> by this example of Juſtice, lets us underſtand that it is Capitall but to intend or pretend violence to the Perſon of a Prince, the Lords Anointed. Yea the villain, preſuming others conſcience to be as corrupt as his own, belies himſelf in expectation of reward. (So there be many nowadayes that miſcheivouſly belie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to have had hands in ſuch and ſuch perillous and unwarrantable facts as indeed they durſt hardly approach; in preſumption to pleaſe men, and be applauded.) But this Caitife was taken at his own word, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred for it, and ſo ought all ſuch to be ſerved, that dare but falſely boaſt to have bin actours in foule miſcheif, amongſt men of honeſt conſcience. Yea, as this <hi>Amalekite</hi> did belie himſelfe into a Treaſon, and worthily ſuffered for it: ſo has this Pamphleter (in this lie of his) little leſſe then treaſonably; and therefore ought to ſuffer in the cenſure of God, and good men. Beſides this <hi>Amalekite;</hi> why were Rechab and Baanah, 2. Sam. 4.10, 11, 12. Shimei, 2. Sam. 16.5. 1. King 2.46. Zimri, 1. King. 16.9, 10, 18, 20. Bigthan and Tereſh, Eſther 2.21, 22.23. Zabad and Jehozabad, 2. King. 12.20, 21. and, 2. Chron. 24.26. and Chap. 25. verſe 3. The ſervants of Amon, 2. King 21, 23, 24. Why (I ſay) were all theſe ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigned, condemned, executed, (ſome according to the Laws of God, ſome of men, ſome of Nature as we reade) and that for <hi>touching the Lords anointed,</hi> with a traiterous touch (whether of hands, mouth, mind or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent) if there was no Law or inhibition concerning Kings properly to forbid them ſo to do? Doubtleſſe the Penalty (ſo ſeverely executed upon them) evicts, that there was (even to this purpoſe) an inhibiting Law, both of God, of Nature, of Nations, and of State.</p>
            <p>Further, Let Chriſtian Subjects and conſcientious lay adviſedly to heart thoſe words of the Apoſtle, Romans 13.1. 2, 5. And if the <hi>Higher Powers</hi> be properly Kings, then whom there is not an higher here on earth, and are onely and immediatly under him, that is the <hi>Higheſt</hi> of all (which of neceſſity muſt be conceded, if theſe words of S. <hi>Paul</hi> be compared with theſe of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> 1. pet. 2.13, 14. For what S. <hi>Paul</hi> here requires <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; S. <hi>Peter</hi> there appropriates it to the King, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> nay, and makes him to be the <hi>Higher</hi> or <hi>Supreme,</hi> in a diſtinction to the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:36658:4"/>inferiour Governour or Magiſtrate.) And if to <hi>reſiſt</hi> (take it as the letter ſounds) be an act of farre more daring inſolence then to <hi>touch;</hi> then aske this Man once more (and you ſhall eaſily have his heart and intent) why this divine inhibition <hi>(of reſiſting Higher Power)</hi> muſt needs be pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly underſtood of Kings: and that divine inhibition <hi>(of touching the Lords Anointed)</hi> muſt by no meanes by properly ſo meant? Tell him, he is nothing ſo tender of the <hi>Sacred Perſon,</hi> as he pretends: that ſeeing he can ſay nothing againſt that Place, where the <hi>Ordinance is not to be reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted;</hi> he onely ſeeks to cavill at that Place, where the <hi>Perſon is not to be touched</hi> And if (to excuſe himſelfe) he anſwer that he meant not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the generall Truth (for he has confeſt it) nor yet to invalide the true intent of other Texts, that might well be produc'd to ſuch a purpoſe, but onely to vindicate this of the Pſalmiſt in particular from the larger application (as he yeilds) to the ſtricter letter: To him I now reply, that I cannot believe this his ſpecious pretext, when I have ſuch evident rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for his ſeditious intent: As,</p>
            <p n="1">1. If he were ſatisfied with this Truth (that <hi>the Lords Anointed is not to be touched, nor the Higher Power reſiſted</hi>) why then labours he to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate one text from it, when he knowes, there are beſides ſo many to be produced for it? So that it is more then manifeſt, it is not a miſapplyed proofe (as he pretends) but the main Truth of all, that he ſtrikes at, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming that the ill affected and eaſily blinded through a conceived vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of one Place will thinke but ſleightly of all other Places to that purpoſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2 If he did onely intend ingenuouſly to vindicate this place of the Pſalme; then what do thoſe other places of Scripture crouded in the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Page, not onely ſo impertinent to the pretended vindication, but ſo calumnious, ſo ſcandalous, and (that I may not ſay treaſonable) merely tending to faction, to ſedition? Even that very thing argues evidently, he never meant to vindicate the ſingle place of Scripture at the top: but only to calumniate and inſtigate, by thoſe many impertinences of abuſed Scripture at the bottom of his Title page. As indeed he doth by all thoſe miſconſtrued and miſapplied Scriptures, this ſeditious Libell quite throughout. Thus, without doubt, yet have his whole intent.</p>
            <p>But now let us examine him according to his pretences. He would vindicate that verſe of the Pſalme <hi>from ſome falſe gloſſes lately obtruded on it by Royalliſts.</hi> Spoken as like a <hi>vulgariſt</hi> as may be. Whoſe common interpretation of Scripture is of more errour then the <hi>Vulgar Tranſlation</hi> it ſelfe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Since he is ſuch a zealous vindicator of texts from falſe gloſſes; why undertakes he none of thoſe many hundreds of places, corrupted
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:36658:4"/>and wreſted by the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and by the <hi>Anababtiſts;</hi> both Authors and Fautours of the greateſt hereſies and ſchiſmes? Nay, why vindicates he not this very <hi>Pſalme and verſe,</hi> from the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> that have taken it from Kings, and given it to Popes? As for the Papiſts, he nibbles indeed a little at them, and letteth you underſtand, their falſe gloſſe upon the place hath beene long ſince exploded: But yet he is envious and tells you not by whom. To ſay truth, it was done, not by any <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ulgariſt,</hi> or <hi>Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt;</hi> but by ſuch as he calls <hi>Royalliſts, and Court-Divines;</hi> Men of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, piety, loyalty, order, diſcretion. Nay, and why vindicates he not this very <hi>Pſalme and verſe,</hi> from the <hi>Anabaptiſts;</hi> that have taken it from both Kings and Prieſts, and given it to the Common people? Hah! the <hi>Anabaptiſts?</hi> why it is onely in their juſtification and behalf, that he is ſo eager in the vindication, who have much abuſed the place, to extirpate prelacy, confound Magiſtracy, and induce Anarchie, by planting here (their own Idol of confuſion) Parity. Hence ſeeking to heighten the vulgar, firſt to a ſpirituall pride, and ſo to a civill rebellion. As well wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth that his main Collection hereupon, with all the dependances; <hi>That ſubjects are Gods anoynted, as well as Kings.</hi> &amp;c. which ſounds pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radoxall to any ſenſible eare. And mark me well; if (together with that) all other the <hi>Proofes</hi> in this <hi>vindication</hi> prove not ſuch.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Paradox. <hi>That this divine inhibition was given to Kings, not to ſubjects. Given</hi> has a fallacy in it. Means he by way of direction, or by way of obligation? If by way of obligation; then this muſt follow, That Kings are here inhibited to <hi>touch</hi> or harm ſubjects: but ſubjects not inhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited here, but rather left at liberty to touch and harme Kings. But as for the mere direction. 1. It is not ſo palpable, that theſe words were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to Kings. And therefore the ancient Fathers (whom this man will have conclude after his expoſition) ſay plainly, that theſe words are not to be found in the hiſtory: but if God uttered them, it was by an Angell or ſome ſecret inſtinct. And although it be ſaid in the preceding verſe of the Pſalme, <hi>he reproved Kings for their ſakes:</hi> yet 'tis not ſo evident and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe that he reproved them by this ſaying. For as much as <hi>Saying</hi> is not in the Hebrew. And therefore this man is ſomewhat too confident; when <hi>(ſaying even to Kigns themſelves)</hi> he peremptorily gloſſes upon a word not found in the text. 2. If we look to the parties literally and hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rically here concened <hi>(Abraham, Iſaac, Jacob)</hi> their ſtory plainly tells, that the inhibition <hi>(touch not)</hi> is not ſo much directed from God to the Kings: as from the Kings to their ſubjects concerning them. Gen. 12.20. Gen. 26.11. 3. Say this were directed to Kings; yet was it not to Kings in regard of their own ſubjects. For <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> &amp;c. may not be ſaid
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:36658:5"/>to be ſubject unto thoſe Heathen Kings. 4. It does not alwaies imply, to whom is the direction, theirs is alſo the Obligation. For we find ſundry both precepts and promiſes in the Scripture, that are ſpoken to one, and yet concerning another. 5. Theſe words ſimply conſidered as concerning the <hi>Lords Anoynted</hi> may have in them the force of a promiſe, as well as a prohibition; and be directed to Princes generally for their faith and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, rather then their charge and obligation. 6. David is inſpired to call the patriarchs <hi>Gods Anoynted,</hi> knowing them to be the ſame deputies, images, and vicegerents of God (as the times were) as he himſelfe was. 7. 'Tis abſurd and ſeditious to ſay, that theſe words were ſpoken onely to Kings, and not to ſubjects; as if the one were ſolely included, and the other here excluded from their duty.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Paradox, <hi>That theſe words were originally ſpoken and intended one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of Abraham, Iſaac</hi> &amp;c.—<hi>Who were neither actuall Kings,</hi>—<hi>nor Kings and Preiſts by office</hi> — <hi>and they were meant of them, not as they were Kings and Prieſts</hi>—<hi>but as forrainers and ſubjects</hi>—<hi>and are to be interpreted and applied, not to Kings and Prieſts, as they are ſuch,</hi> —<hi>but to the faithfull,</hi> though, and as ſubjects. In ſuch a throng of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radoxes, the man is ſo overſeen, that he is forced in ſome things to thwart and contradict himſelfe. As that Abraham, Iſaac &amp;c. were neither Kings nor Prieſts; and again, that theſe words were not meant of them, as they were Kings and Prieſts. Where he grants the relation, onely denies the application. Item, that theſe words are to be applied not to Kings; and yet he willingly and cordially profeſſes the place may be <hi>aptly applied</hi> to their perſonall ſafety. But where he happens to favour himſelfe, let us now ſee the truth &amp; the Scriptures contradicting him. 1. When he ſaith, <hi>That theſe words were originally ſpoken and intended of Abraham</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally</hi> it may be, if he mean hiſtorically, but not <hi>Only:</hi> For thus he barres hinſelfe of his own ſence in the generall, while he ſolely ties it up to this Particular. <hi>Spoken</hi> it may be too, but not <hi>intended.</hi> For there's no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion but <hi>David</hi> intended here to inciude himſelfe and his Poſterity, as <hi>The Lords Anointed:</hi> as appeares in that he made it for a conſtant and publick Pſalme of thankſgiving, 1. Chron. 16.7. Now acts and inſtances of perpetuall and ſolemne Services ought not to be reſtrained to tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary or private concernments. 2. <hi>That Abraham, Iſaac, &amp;c. were nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther actuall Kings and Prieſts, neither Kings and Prieſts by office.</hi> The Man is mightily deceived: They were Kings and Prieſts (though not ſo rituall and ceremoniall as afterwards) yet actuall and by office. It is too too plain againſt him; the Patriarchs governed not onely in Oeconomie, but in Policy, even ſo farre as in higheſt affaires, <hi>viz.</hi> of life and death, in
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:36658:5"/>peace and warre. They likewiſe built altars, and offered ſacrifice. God calls <hi>Abraham a Prophet,</hi> Gen. 20.7. and the children of <hi>Heth</hi> call him <hi>a mighty Prince</hi> or King. Gen. 23.6. And as they called the Patriarch a King; ſo S. <hi>Peter</hi> calls a King a Patriarch, Acts. 2.29. ſo little difference he underſtood betweene them. Neither was it other for ſubſtance then one government of God, that began in the <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> went through the <hi>Judges,</hi> and ended or reſted in <hi>Kings.</hi> They being all equally of one type, deputation, preſentation, vicegerencie. 3. <hi>That the Patriarchs were Subjects.</hi> That's a kind of Bull or contradiction, to ſay, Patriarchs and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects: for the word Patriarch ſounds ſuch a thing as King. And they were ſuch, as is proved above. And Kings are but Patriarchs or cheife go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning Fathers of their Countreys. How were the Patriarchs Subjects to thoſe amongſt whom they ſojourned? When as <hi>Abraham</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging himſelfe a <hi>Sojourner,</hi> they accounted him nevertheleſſe <hi>a mighty Prince amongſt them,</hi> Gen. 23.4.6. when themſelves acknowledged that <hi>they were mightier then they.</hi> Gen. 26.16. when battaile was given by one of theſe, to foure of thoſe at once with victory thereupon. Gen. 14.14. when they were glad to treat with them as free Princes, to article and covenant with them for mutuall priviledges and indemnity, Gen. 21.21, 22.23. Gen. 26.28, 29. In one word, If the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs were Subjects to thoſe amongſt whom they ſojourned (as this man falſely impoſes upon all Expoſitours) then let him ſhew us from them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where the Patriarchs did appeale to their Lawes; (either for matter of Policie or Religion) and whether it was lawfull for them ſo to do? or if they were at any time ſubdued to that ſubjection? But ſince it is ſo clear, that the Patriarchs were not Subjects but Princes; now then it followes neceſſarily, that theſe words of the Pſalme are to be underſtood of them, not as Subjects, but as Princes; and in that reſpect chiefly they are here called <hi>Gods Anointed.</hi> So that now the ſence and ſumme of theſe words are literally and genuinely thus to be collected and apprehended; as God ſhould ſay, O ye Kings &amp; Princes of the Nations, <hi>Touch not,</hi> with any of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer or violence, <hi>Mine,</hi> whom I have choſen to my ſelfe before all the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the earth: <hi>Mine Anointed,</hi> ſuch as are conſecrated to be Kings and Princes in a more ſpeciall manner then your ſelves: and have more right (by my promiſe) to dwell and rule in this land, then you: Nay, to whom I (whoſe the earth is and all that dwell therein) have given and ſubjected you. So that it is thus more then manifeſt that God ſpeaks theſe words of the Pſalme to the nations, even the greateſt and proudeſt of them, whom he had execrated already and devoted into ſubjection to the Patriarchs and Princes, whom he had voted and conſecrated either to ſubdue or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpate
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:36658:6"/>them as enemies; or elſe (as ſervants and Subjects) to reigne and rule over them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Paradox, <hi>That the People and Subjects are Gods Anointed as well as Kings.</hi> The man does ſeem cordially to profeſſe, <hi>that Kings (in ſacred writ) are commonly called Gods anointed, &amp;c.</hi> And to this purpoſe hee heaps his proofs in figures and not in words at length. And that's not ſo cordially, as cunningly done. For the many proofs that are againſt him them he gives you but groſſely, and in a clutter; as if it did even irk him to recite them. But the few proofes that he would have make for him them he drawls out at length. And why ſo? Becauſe did he not curtall thoſe former texts, the very recitall would ſufficiently confute him. And all ſenſible men might reade at once, and perceive, That Kings are not onely <hi>Gods Anointed</hi> in the generall; but by a ſpeciall Emphaſis called the Lords <hi>Anointed.</hi> Nor yet <hi>commonly ſo called;</hi> but really ſo conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. And not onely is it with an oyle of outward rite and Ceremony: but according to an Ordinance of perpetuall truth and myſtery. As ſhall fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther appeare in examination of the ſo vehemently urged proofs for his opinion. <hi>viz.</hi> Pſal. 28.8. where the <hi>Anointed</hi> in the 8. verſe, he will have to be the <hi>People</hi> mentioned in the 9. verſe. When as the 8. verſe hath the full ſenſe in it ſelfe. And not only ſo, but <hi>David</hi> there diſtinguiſhes betwixt the <hi>Plebs</hi> (as they tranſlate it) and the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nctus.</hi> And ſpeakes of them in the Plurall; of himſelfe (for Gods Anointed) in the ſingular number. Neither is it unlawfull for <hi>David</hi> in the Pſalmes, to ſpeake of himſelfe in the third Perſon; as appeares Pſal. 18.50. which is the next place, he ſeekes to wreſt to his purpoſe. Where ſince he cannot deny <hi>his Anointed</hi> to be <hi>David and his ſeed:</hi> he therefore will have <hi>David</hi> and his ſeed there, to be <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Elect.</hi> Which ſenſe (we deny not) may be orthodoxally admitted in the allegorie: but by his leave, we may not ſuffer the genuine ſenſe of the letter to be rejected; unleſſe he can make it plaine, there is ſuch an abſurdity in the literall, that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſtand with reaſon, but muſt neceſſarily therefore be transferred to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother ſenſe. Now theſe words in the bare and expreſſe letter are faire and full ſenſe, either backewards or forwards. <hi>His King, his anointed, David: David, his anointed, his King.</hi> Which words (either way) will primarily beare no other ſenſe then this, that <hi>David</hi> propoſes himſelfe to be Gods <hi>Anointed,</hi> as he was a <hi>King.</hi> And is not this a moſt excellent <hi>Vindicatour</hi> now, and ſincere? that pretending (as his maine worke) to reſcue and rectifie one verſe of a <hi>Pſalme,</hi> according to the originall ſenſe and meaning; and yet to that purpoſe, ſticks not to falſifie and diſtort two? His next Place is Hab. 3.13. Is it poſſible, that the man ſhould be
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:36658:6"/>ſo blinded, as not to diſtinguiſh there; betwixt, <hi>for thy people and with thine Anointed?</hi> The words expreſſely teach, that the <hi>Prophet</hi> there ſpeakes of them as two. As namely, <hi>for them,</hi> whoſe benefit was the end; <hi>with him,</hi> whoſe authority was the meanes. It is very plaine from the two preceding verſes, that by the <hi>People,</hi> the Prophet intends the <hi>Iſrael<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites:</hi> and by he <hi>anointed, Joſhua,</hi> their Captaine. And I pray now, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was <hi>Ioſhua</hi> a Subject, or a ſupreame Magiſtrate? Thus he is quite out of the old Teſtament; where Kings and Princes (in a peculiar manner) are above 30 times called <hi>Gods anointed.</hi> Now let us ſee how he would faine helpe himſelfe in the New, <hi>viz.</hi> 2. Cor. 1.21. Now, though I might here diſtinguiſh of anointing; yet the exactneſſe of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion bids me here ſave the labour. <hi>Hath anointed</hi> (ſaith S. <hi>Paul</hi> to the People of <hi>Corinth</hi>) not you, but <hi>us,</hi> and <hi>hath eſtabliſhed us with you;</hi> it may be preciſely interpreted of his Officiall rather then Perſonall unction; as of his Apoſtleſhip, preiſthood, miniſtry, to which God hath anointed or ordained him, and had eſtabliſh't or confirmed him with, or amongſt them. But what ſay we to that Place, he cites, 1. Joh. 2.27. Here I yeild that Gods faithfull People, though Subjects have an <hi>anointing:</hi> but I dare not therefore inferre hence, that they are (in all points) Gods anointed, much leſſe, as well as Kings. For the <hi>Anointing</hi> here, is the holy Ghoſt, and his gifts; who though he anoint all the Elect to the generall calling of Chriſtians; yet not to the ſpeciall calling of Kings, and Preiſts. All true Chriſtians are anointed with the ſpirituall unction, that of regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: but not with the regall unction, that of inauguration; nor with the ſacerdotall unction, that of miniſtration. Laſtly to thoſe places, 1. Pet. 2. 5.9. Rev. 1.6. and 5.10. Thoſe Places are ſufficiently cleared by all ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox Divines (whether you call them <hi>Lutherans,</hi> or <hi>Calviniſts</hi>) againſt the <hi>Anabaptiſts:</hi> who blindly preſuming hence, of an equall account with God; would hereupon proudly account themſelves equall with all men. And thus abuſe thoſe places, as arguments for their fanatick Parity, both in Church and Common-wealth. But the learned and orthodox (as I ſay) diſſolve thoſe arguments (and in that reſolve all good Chriſtians) by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing: As namely, that all true Chriſtians are Kings and Prieſts 1. Comparatively, in reference to the heathen and uncalled: as may well be gathered fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thoſe words in the old Teſtament, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19.6. from which theſe in the New, are taken &amp; applied. Yea and S. <hi>Peter</hi> expreſſes ſo much, a <hi>royall Prieſthood,</hi> that is, <hi>a choſen generation, a peculiar people, which in times paſt were not a People.</hi> 2. Spiritually, and in a large ſenſe, As S. <hi>Peter</hi> alſo expounds himſelfe in the one place <hi>a royall Prieſt hood, that is, an holy
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:36658:7"/>nation to offer up ſpirituall ſacrifices.</hi> And ſo doth S. John in the other, <hi>Kings and Prieſts,</hi> not to men, but <hi>to God.</hi> Offering up ſacrifices of prayers and praiſes; reigning and ruling over their own carnall luſts and concupiſcences. And thus much the man himſelf cannot but confeſſe, <hi>That all true Chriſtians are Kings and Prieſts in a ſpirituall ſence, though they be but Subjects in a Politicke ſence.</hi> Having ſaid thus much himſelf, I wonder what it is the Man would now contend for. Let Chriſtians be ſubject in a politick ſence (yet not merely politick neither, but out of Conſcience, and with reſpect to the divine ordinance) and who will deny them to be Kings and Prieſts in a ſpirituall ſence? Will any Chriſtian King envy his Subjects they eternall crown of glory (as he ſpeaks) and their reigning with <hi>Chriſt</hi> for ever, ſo they intrench not upon his tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Crown; nor uſurpe to reigne with him here on Earth? After this his own diſtinction, mark now what is become of his Propoſition, <hi>That all the faithfull are Gods anoynted, as well as Kings.</hi> Belike he meanes it one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in a ſpirituall ſence: and then it is no more, then if he had ſaid thus, That all good Chriſtians are Chriſtians as well as Kings; becauſe Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an ſignifies Anointed.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Paradox, <hi>That it is more unlawfull for Kings to make warre upon their Subjects, by way of offence, then for Subjects, to take up armes againſt Kigns, by way of defence.</hi> All this is beſides the vindication of the Pſalme; I ſhall therefore be the leſſe upon it. Otherwiſe this very point were worth a treatiſe: which is not to be lookt for in a pamphlets refutation, That poore piece of the <hi>Pſalme</hi> is but the pretence, here is the matter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended. While he ſtumbles about that, he hopes the ignorant and ill-af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected will ſwallow down this. But he ſhall never reſolve nor perſwade wiſe men and conſciencious; unleſſe he will take pains not to determine raſhly but to diſcuſſe orderly, and inſtruct ſoundly, in theſe 3 points at leaſt, 1 What warre offenſive, and defenſive is. 2. How farre forth a man may be defenſive onely, and yet not offenſive. 3. Whether the defenſive, or offenſive, be on this ſide or that. To determine all theſe aright, were to ſatisfie conſciences: but to urge and inveigh upon ſuppoſalls, is to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle them ſo much the more. Yet conſider a little what he ſaies upon ſuppoſition: <hi>It is more unlawfull?</hi> that argues ſome unlawfulneſſe, as well on one ſide, as another. <hi>Subjects may take up armes merely defenſive;</hi> Not offenſive then in any caſe; much leſſe merely offenſive. Why may they do ſo, as he ſaies? becauſe they are <hi>Gods anoynted too.</hi> Is that his maine reaſon for their taking up armes? well. And how are they <hi>Gods anoynted?</hi> He ſaies himſelf, in a <hi>Spirituall ſence.</hi> Why then, by the force of his own argument their armes ought onely to be ſpirituall. For they are not (as
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:36658:7"/>he grants) Gods anoynted in a <hi>Politicke ſenſe;</hi> and therefore politick their armes muſt not be. But he ha's other under-reaſons. Becauſe <hi>God hath forbidden Kings to injure or oppreſſe their Subjects, being his anoynted faithfull Chriſtians.</hi> So are they inhibited though their Subjects were Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And God hath likewiſe inhibited Subjects to reſiſt and injure Kings. Item. <hi>God hath puniſhed and plagued Kings for ſo doing.</hi> Note then, that it is in God to puniſh them. And, beſides that he delivers them to Kings to puniſh them; God will likewiſe plague Subjects if they offend their Kings. Item, <hi>that there is no law of God or man, that hath given Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to Kings, to injure or oppreſſe their ſubjects</hi>—<hi>wage warre againſt them,</hi> &amp;c. How much leſſe is there for ſubjects then? Item, <hi>that there is an Oath at the Coronation for Kings to obſerve:</hi> So there is for Subjects likewiſe, <hi>an Oaths of Allegiance.</hi> But why perſiſt I in replying to theſe? Himſelf ſaies, he ranks his reaſons to clear this point<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>That Kings muſt no more offer violence to their Subjects perſons or eſtates (without legall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, and juſt cauſe) then they offer violence to their Kings.</hi> A point as clear as the noon day, though he had produced never a reaſon for it. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide theſe, and many his other inſtances of Scripture, although true in themſelves, and to be regarded with tremblings: yet thus abuſed by this vile man, they are onely to be anſwered with indignation and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horring<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe they are urged upon falſe grounds and ſuppoſitions, and with a calumnious and ſeditions intent.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Paradox, <hi>That Kings were created by, and for their ſubjects,</hi> &amp;c. The reſt of it is ſo ſawcy, that it is not for a modeſt man to repeat. And this alſo is quite beſides the propoſed vindication: and ſerves onely to ſpeak the intention of the Author, Sedition. Yet is this he ſaies, as falſe, as ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, quite contrary to Scriptures. As. Prov. 8.15, 16. <hi>By me Kings reigne,</hi> (ſaies God) and therefore not by men. Dan. 4.2. <hi>The moſt high giveth the Kingdome to whomſoever he will;</hi> and not they, Rom. 13.1, 2, 3, 4. <hi>The high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Powers are Gods Ordinance,</hi> and not mans. <hi>Gods Miniſters</hi> they are, and therefore not the <hi>Peoples Servants.</hi> Why are they called <hi>Gods,</hi> Pſal. 82.6. John 10.34, 35. but becauſe they are immediately from God, and repreſent God here on earth, as types and images of Gods divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, Chriſts Kingly office, and the Angelicall order: yea and as the perfection of humane ſociety, and of the Communion of Saints? What ſay they; when even wicked Kings are Gods ordinance. 1. Sam. 12.13. and ſent of God, not for their owne ſo much, as for the peoples ſinne, Prov. 28.2. We ſay, there are foure ends of a Kings being: the firſt is Gods glory; the ſecond is his owne Salvation; the third is the good of the Church, the fourth is the welfare of the State, (which conſiſts as well in
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:36658:8"/>puniſhing, as rewarding, Rom. 13.3, 4.) Now becauſe the people are one end; will they therefore claime to be the whole efficient? though the people may ſecondarily, and in ſome circumſtances. be intereſſed; as in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection (where any ſuch cuſtome is) in the inauguration, the Counſell, the aſſiſtance,  yet can they have no right of challenge to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, or primary fundamentall, the Ordinance, the Power, which is of God.</p>
            <p>Yet let us take the beſt of this man as well as the worſt. His intent (he ſaies) <hi>is not to foment this unnaturall deſtructive warre,</hi> &amp;c. It was exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable for any man to ſay otherwiſe. And therefore even thoſe that endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour it are notwithſtanding aſhamed to proclaime it. But he profeſſes further; <hi>that Kings are Gods Anoynted, and in that reſpect, their Perſons are ſacred; and no violence ought to be exerciſed upon their perſons, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially by their Subjects.</hi> As he confeſſes, is cleare, 1. Sam. 24.3. to 12.17.18.19. and chap. 26.7. to 25.2. Sam. 1.2. to 7. Nevertheleſſe, this is not ſo cordially ſpoken as he pretends. Becauſe he conceals a great part of the truth. For Kings are to be preſerved inviolable, not only in their perſons, but likewiſe in their Name and Honour, as is alſo cleare, Exod. 22.28. Eccles. 10.20. Alſo in their Government and Authority; Rom, 13.1.2. Jude 8. As alſo in their rights and revenues, Matt. 22.21. Rom. 13.7. Theſe be matters worthy of a ſerious Treatiſe by it ſelfe (ſcarce to be medled with in a by-confutation) to the intent people may know, that all Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and obedience of Subjects, is not meerely tyed to the perſon of a Prince. And therefore that a care or zeale to the perſon, is not to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in an injury or neglect to all the reſt.</p>
            <p>But I hold my duty here done to revindicate Pſalme 105.15. from ſuch falſe gloſſes as are notoriouſly obtruded on it by him here: and have been heretofore by (his like) the Anabaptiſts now therefore his proofs all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Paradoxall; let us (ere we end) looke a little into his Authorities. His Authorities? where are they? why he ſayes, S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> with ſundry other expoſitors, conclude of the ſenſe of this place according to his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. He but ſayes ſo: but let us heare and ſee what S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> himſelf, and others ſay indeed upon the place.</p>
            <p>S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> moves this queſtion, How the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> could be called <hi>anointed, antequam eſſet unctio,</hi> before the regall anointing as yet was. It is very plain he ſpeaks of the regall anointing; for he addes immediately <hi>Ex qua hoc nomen impoſitum eſt Regibus:</hi> by which anointing the name <hi>Anointed</hi> is attributed to Kings.

               <hi>quaere</hi> is onely this. Why this name <hi>anointed</hi> uſuall and proper to Kings, ſhould be ſpoken of the <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> while as yet no ſuch unction was in uſe? And it is to be ſupplied in anſwer, That the regall unction as yet was not in the rituall way of it; but in the virtuall way it was. And if the man thinke to ſnatch advantage, becauſe the Father ſpeaks at large, <hi>ideo Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſti, quia etiamſi latenter, jam tamen Chriſtiani.</hi> That the Patriarchs might therefore not amiſſe be called <hi>anointed,</hi> becauſe they were even then Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, though veiled. Let him look before that, and he ſhall find him ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding it in a ſtraiter ſenſe: <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nde ergò illi jam tunc Chriſti appellaban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur? nam Prophet as illos fuiſſe legimus.</hi> Why were the Patriarchs then called <hi>anointed?</hi> becauſe (as we reade) they were Proph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3+ letters">

               </gap> And before that (as the firſt ſenſe) ſpeaking of the ſpeciall anointing; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

               </gap> makes the ſame to begin and reſt onely in Kings, <hi>Quod à Saule coepit, cui David ſucceſſit in regno, atque inde caeteri &amp; reges Iudae, &amp; reges Iſrael, continuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one ſacratae conſuetudinis ungebantur.</hi> Which name <hi>anointed</hi> began in <hi>Saul,</hi> whom <hi>David</hi> ſucceeded in the kingdome, and thence was the ſacred rite continued to the ſeverall Kings of Iſraell and Judah. Now let the Man ſhew us how S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> excludes Kings here from being Gods <hi>anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi> or (reſpectively) expounds it of Subjects, or once intimates hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that Subjects are Gods Anointed, as well as Kings.</p>
            <p>S. <hi>Hierome</hi> vindicates this place of the Pſalme iuſtly againſt certaine Jewiſh Doctours, who in hatred to Chriſt our Lord; the true Meſſiah, perverſely ſeemed to argue hence, That none were to be called <hi>Chriſti, Anointed,</hi> that were not anointed with the Regall unguent. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he inferres, <hi>Ecce, ante Legem, Patriarchae, non uncti regaliun. guento Chriſti dicuntur.</hi> Behold. before the Law, the Patriarches are called Anointed, which were not anointed with the regall unction. And that he meanes materially. And even that intimates that Kings which (ſince the Law) are not anointed ſo materially and ſo ritually, are nevertheleſſe virtually and divinely, Gods anointed. Further, leſt any ſhould imagine, that he ſhould exempt Kings from being ſpecially un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood in this place; he elſewhere applies it to them alone. As com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting upon Iſai. 45.1. Where God calls King <hi>Cyrus</hi> his anointed, and that according to the manner of the Hebrewes, whoſe regall enſigne was anointing; <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nde &amp; Saul Chriſtus Domini dicitur, &amp; in Pſalmis le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gimus, Nolite tangere Chriſtos meos.</hi> Whereupon (ſayes the Father) <hi>Saul</hi> is called the Lords anointed; and likewiſe we reade in the Pſalme, <hi>Touch not mine anointed,</hi>

            <p>Theſe two be the chiefe of the ancient Expoſitours whom <hi>Proſper, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nobius, Caſſiodore,</hi> venerable <hi>Bede, Bruno,</hi> and others doe follow, diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing indeed moſtly betwixt the materiall, and the ſpirituall Chriſme or unction. But it behoves to underſtand the reaſon of this warineſſe in diſcerning. It was principally becauſe the hereticall <hi>Rabbines</hi> ſtrove here to exclude <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as the ſchiſmaticall <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> ſtrive here to exclude Kings. We conclude therefore againſt them both, making up the true and full ſenſe of the verſe of this Pſalme, with that of another, <hi>viz.</hi> Pſal. 45. Though all Chriſtians be Gods anointed in a ſpirituall ſenſe; yet as concerning <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and Kings; (one in the myſticall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the other in the in the literall ſenſe) <hi>God, even their God hath anointed them above their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes.</hi> Wherefore be it properly and ſpecially, not onely ſaid but laid to the Conſciences of all men, young and old, rich and poore, high and low, many or few,</p>
